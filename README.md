# ‚òÅÔ∏èüîóüß† api2ai

‚ö° Generate a conversational AI from any Open API spec ‚ö°

## Installation & Basic Usage

`yarn add --save api2ai`

The following example builds on top of OpenAI API, essentially creating a single endpoint for all OpenAI endpoints. Please check out the [demo code](https://github.com/mquan/api2ai/blob/main/demo/pages/api/ai.ts) for more details.

```typescript
import { ApiAgent } from "@api2ai";

const OPEN_AI_KEY = "sk-...";

// This example builds on top of the OpenAI API, essentially creating a single API for all OpenAI endpoints.
const agent = new ApiAgent({
  apiKey: OPEN_AI_KEY,
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", // "gpt-4-turbo-0613" also works
  api: "path/to/your/open-api-spec.yaml",
});

const result = await agent.execute({
  userPrompt: "Create an image of Waikiki beach",
  context: { token: OPEN_AI_KEY },
});
```

## Features

api2ai allows you to integrate to any API using English, or any natural language:

- Automatically parses API spec and auth schemes
- Select endpoint and parse arguments provided in user prompt
- Invoke the API call and return the response
- Conserve tokens to reduce OpenAI cost, also bypass OpenAI 64 functions limit.
